      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This visualization displays four key indicators – Stress, Sleep, Mood, and Productivity – 
        across six months. The goal is to understand how academic load, exams, and holidays affect 
        students' mental health patterns.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The data was entered in Google Sheets, cleaned for consistency, exported as CSV, and then
        visualized using Tableau Public. This ensures a clean and accurate dataset for generating insights.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stress is highest during exam months (June, October).</li>
        <li>Sleep and mood improve considerably during holidays (July).</li>
        <li>Productivity is strongly influenced by stress and rest levels.</li>
